 1 - login.
 Login is done from server. We only retrieve json data that contain username, profile url, replies_to_me and no cookies stored locally. So every action that require authentication, we will re-login the user.

 2 - reply to topic.
 Currently support "fast reply". Need to back and press the topic again to view your reply ... lol
